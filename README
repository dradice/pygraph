pygraph
=======

A freely available, lightweight and easy to use visualization client for
viewing 1D data files.

pygraph is a PyQt re-implementation of xGraph and yGraph:

Requirements
------------

* >= python-2.6
* >= PyQt-4.4
* >= PyQwt-5.2
* >= scidata-0.1
* >= qt-4.4
* >= qwt-5.2

Mouse shortcuts
---------------

* Left click + drag:        zoom-in
* Right click:              previous zoom settings
* Shift + Right click:      next zoom settings
* Middle click:             original zoom settings

Data transformations
--------------------

Data transformations strings are evaluated as lambda functions with
numpy expressions.

Example: shifting the data and removing a secular trend

  x' = x + 0.5

  y' = y + 0.1*sin(x)*x

Example: computing the derivative of the data

  x' = x

  y' = D(y)/D(x)

Bad example: a constant cannot be used as an argument for a lambda function

  x' = x

  y' = 5

Example: setting y to a constant value

  x' = x

  y' = 5 + 0*y
