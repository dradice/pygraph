pygraph
=======

A freely available, lightweight and easy to use visualization client for
viewing 1D data files.

pygraph is a PyQt re-implementation of xGraph and yGraph:

News
----

pygraph now uses PythonQwt a pure python replacement of PyQwt, built on top of
PyQt. This should greately simplify porting pygraph to new machines. 


Requirements
------------

* >= python-2.6
* >= PyQt-4.4
* >= PythonQwt-0.5.5
* >= scidata-0.1
* >= qt-4.4


Installation
------------

After all the required packages are installed, pygraph can be installed using
the following commands

$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/dradice/pygraph.git

$ cd pygraph

$ sudo python setup.py install


Mouse shortcuts
---------------

* Left click + drag:        zoom-in
* Right click:              previous zoom settings
* Shift + Right click:      next zoom settings
* Middle click:             original zoom settings


Data transformations
--------------------

Data transformations strings are evaluated as lambda functions with
numpy expressions.

Example: shifting the data and removing a secular trend

  x' = x + 0.5

  y' = y + 0.1*sin(x + 2*pi*t)*x

Example: computing the derivative of the data

  x' = x

  y' = D(y)/D(x)


Command Line Interface
----------------------

pygraph can be invoked from the command-line as

$ pygraph

It is possible to specify a list of files to open with

$ pygraph file1 file2 ...

One can specify which data column to read from an ASCII file with the syntax

$ pygraph file.xg ^5

If the column is not specified pygraph will use a reasonable default. Note that
the column number for the coordinates is currently hard coded for each datafile
format.

In the case a dataset is split over different files it is possible
to make pygraph automatically merge them, by simply enclosing the relevant
list of files within curly brackets as:

$ pygraph { rho.1.xg rho.2.xg rho.3.h5 } { */data/vel[0].x.asc }

Please notice the space between the brackets and the file list.

In case you wish to combine two datasets, using the y-data of the second one
as the x-data of the first one, you can use

$ pygraph file1 @ file2

this will plot file1 using file2 y-data as its x-data.

You can also use {}, ^ and @ together, as in

$ pygraph { file1 ^2 file2 ^3 } @ { file3 file4 ^4 }

Note that in the second group the 4th column is used for both files.

For more informations see

$ pygraph --help


Pygraph data format (.pyg)
--------------------------

pygraph also has its own HDF5-based data format. You should consider using this
format over the old xgraph ASCII format when creating large data files as
reading PYG data does not require any (slow) string parsing.

The .PYG data format is undocumented, but a reference C implementation of a
.PYG writer is provided in the "lib" directory.
